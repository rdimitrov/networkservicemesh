# Network Service Mesh - Quick Start Guide

This document will help you configure two Vagrant boxes in a Kubernetes cluster with a master and a worker node. You will also deploy the Network Service Mesh components in the cluster.

## Prerequisites

You can find instructions for your operation systems in the links below:

* [CentOS](prereq-centos.md)
* [OSX](prereq-osx.md)
* [Ubuntu](prereq-ubuntu.md)

If you have another Linux distribution or prefer to go with the upstream, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)

### Getting the Network Service Mesh project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/networkservicemesh/networkservicemesh
cd networkservicemesh
```

## Build the Network Service Mesh images

First, let's build the Docker images of the various components:

```bash
make k8s-save
```

## Setup the local Vagrant environment

Then we'll configure a Kubernetes cluster. A master and a worker node will be launched in two separate Vagrant machines. The Network Service Mesh components will then be deployed to the cluster.

Start the Vagrant machines:

```bash
make vagrant-start
```

Ensure your `kubectl` is configured to point to Vagrant's Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
source scripts/vagrant/env.sh
```

## Deploy the core Network Service Mesh components

The core Network Service Mesh infrastructure is deployed with the following command:

```bash
make k8s-infra-deploy
```

### Verify the services are up and running

The following check should show two `nsmgr`, two `nsm-vppagent-dataplane`, two `skydive-agent`, one `crossconnect-monitor` and one `skydive-analyzer` pods:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n nsm-system
```

This will allow you to see your Network Service Mesh daemonset running:

```bash
kubectl get daemonset nsmgr -n nsm-system


NAME   DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   NODE SELECTOR   AGE
nsmgr   2         2         2       2            2           <none>          19m
```

## Deploy the Network Service Mesh examples

Now that we have the NSM infrastructure deployed, we can proceed with deploying some of the examples.

* The basic ICMP example is deployed like this:

```bash
make k8s-icmp-deploy
```

* The VPN service composition example is deployed with:

```bash
make k8s-vpn-deploy
```

## Verify deploying the examples

Both of the examples can be verified by running a simple check:

```bash
make k8s-check
```

* For ICMP you should see ping succeeding as below:

```bash
./scripts/nsc_ping_all.sh

* Validating the VPN example will output the following:

```bash
